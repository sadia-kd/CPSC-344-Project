# CPSC-344-Project Yelp Restaurant Browsing UX Project


This repository contains materials from a **user-centered design project** for UBC's **CPSC 344** course (completed in Spring 2025), focused on improving the experience of searching and browsing restaurants using Yelp. The project included **conceptual design, low- and medium-fidelity prototyping in Google Slides, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing**.


## Project Overview
- Developed two conceptual models inspired by **Goodreads** (desktop) and **TikTok** (mobile) to support different browsing behaviors.
- Created low- and medium-fidelity prototypes in **Google Slides** to test interface navigation and key features.
- Conducted cognitive walkthroughs and usability studies with anonymized participants.
- Collected both **quantitative metrics** (task times, errors) and **qualitative feedback** (interviews, satisfaction ratings).
- Generated design recommendations for interface improvements.
